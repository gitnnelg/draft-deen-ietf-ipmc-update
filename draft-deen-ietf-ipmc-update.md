# Introduction

The IETF Trust, a Virginia Common Trust was established in 2005 to be the intellectucal property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF activity. The IETF Trust has held and managed IPR rights including those granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78, currently specified in RFC5378 and its predecessors.

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a Delaware not-for-profit corportion established in 2022 to succeed the IETF Trust, replacing it and assuming all its roles and responsibitlies.

This document recognizes for IETF documentation purposes the IETF IPMC's successor role and updates IETF documents with this recognition.

## IETF Trust

The [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) has provided intellectual property management for the IETF since 2005.  Following BCP78, authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents grant to the IETF Trust a set of rights to their works to enable the work to be used within the IETF activity. This supports the document streams as described in the RFC9280.

## IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC), a Delaware not-for-profit corporation, was incorporated in 2022 with the purpose of being the successor to the IETF Trust, continuing on the role and traditions of the IETF Trust and providing [IETF Intellectual Propoerty Management (IPM)](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) just as the IETF Trust has done since 2005.

# Updates

## References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

The term "IETF Trust" is used in two ways in IETF RFCs and BCPs, both as the descriptive name for the role of holding IPR and the name of the legal entity which performs the role such as mentions in RFC5378.

The role henceforth may be formally named IETF Intellectual Property Management (IPM), while the legal name IETF Intellectual Property Management Corportation (IPMC) shall be recgonized as the successor name of the IETF Trust.

## Use of IETF Trust and IETF Intellectusl Property in Copyright Boilerplate

Copyright boilerplate, the notice that appears in Internet Drafts (I-Ds) and published Requests for Comments (RFCs) is declared in the Legal Provisions which provide licensing information about the works held in the IETF Trust and IETF IPMC. Since this boiilerplate is pubished by the IETF Trust and its successor the IETF IPMC,  while it is coordinated with the IETF's BCP 78 updates, it is not included in this update.

### Intellectual Propoerty Rights Held by IETF Trust

The rights held by the IETF Trust will transfer to its successor the IETF IPMC. Inquiries may continue to be made to the IETF IPMC for licenses and other rights management topics.


## IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors Appointment

RFC8714 details how Trustees are appointed to the IETF Trust.  Henceforth, the process detailed in RFC8714 is updated to also apply to the appointment of the Directors of the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) a Delaware not-for-profit Corporation established in 2022.  Until the final shutdown of the IETF Trust legal entity, the appointments of Directors of the IPMC are understood to be the same persons the appointing bodies have appointed as Trustees of the IETF Trust.
