# Introduction

The IETF Trust, a Virginia trust, was established in 2005 as the intellectual property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF. The IETF Trust has held and managed IPR, including those granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78, currently specified in {{!RFC5378}} and its predecessors.

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a Delaware not-for-profit corporation established in 2022 with the intention of being the successor to the IETF Trust, replacing it and assuming all of its roles and responsibilities.

This document updates RFC 5378, RFC8714 and other IETF documents to recognize that the IETF IPMC is now the proper custodian of all IETF-related intellectual property rights and successor in interest to the IETF Trust.


#  Updates

## References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

All references to “IETF Trust” in any IETF document, including RFCs, BCPs, Internet-Drafts, and other IETF publications, shall be read and interpreted as referring to the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IETF IPMC) as the successor entity.
The IETF IPMC has assumed all rights, responsibilities, and obligations previously held by or attributed to the IETF Trust in such documents.

## Websites and URLs

### IETF IPR

The IETF publishes information on intellectual property rights (IPR) at [IETF IPR](https://ietf.org/ipr) and more general information at [ietf IPR process](https://ietf.org/process/ipr) dealing with IETF IPR topiucs in general and including patents.

The IETF Trust and the IETF IPMC do not handle patents and all IETF related patent considerations continue to be handled direcetly through the IETF at the cited web pages.

### IETF Trust

The IETF Trust, historically has published information related to licensing, assets, finances and notices of actions and changes on it's web site [https://trustee.ietf.org](https://trustees.ietf.org).  This web site shall be maintained in perpetuity as URLs to it appear in published documents and the Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) version 1.0-5.0 that were active at the time of an I-D submission and the date of a RFC publication will continue to apply to those works even after subsequent transfer of those IPR assets to the IETF IPMC.   The existing URLs in the required copyright boilerplate and other sections of I-Ds and RFCs will continue to work correctly for users of those documents.

### IETF IPMC

The IETF IPMC, has established [https://www.ietf-ipm.org](https://www.ietf-ipm.org) as its official corporate website which it will use to publish governance and operational information including bylaws and financial statements, along with the updated Technical Legal Provisions (TLP 6.0) which provide licensing terms for I-Ds and RFCs whose copyrights are held by the IETF IPMC.

## Use of IETF Trust and IETF IPMC in other IETF IPR Framework Documents

The intellectual property rights framework for IETF contributions is established in RFC 5378 (BCP 78).  The IETF Trust has implemented this framework through its [Trust Legal Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) at https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions, and the IETF IPMC will continue this implementation as the successor entity.

All references to the IETF Trust in {{!RFC5378}} and related operational documents shall be read as referring to the IETF IPMC effective upon the transition.

Updated versions of required copyright notices in I-Ds and RFCs reflecting this change can be found in Section 6 of the [IPMC TLP](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp) at https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp.

Note that no retroactive changes of copyright notices in prior IETF documents are to be made.

## Advice to the IPMC Directors on the IETF IPMC on Rights to be Granted in IETF Documents

{{!RFC8721}} is advice to the IETF Trustees of the IETF Trust on rights to be granted in IETF documents.   This advice is updated to be to the IETF IPMC and its directors.

## Intellectual Property Rights Held by IETF Trust

The rights held by the IETF Trust have transferred to the IETF IPMC, as the successor the IETF Trust.  Inquiries regarding licenses and other IPR topics should now be made to the IETF IPMC.

## RFC Streams

{{!RFC8729}} defines a series of RFC Streams - IETF, IAB, IRTF and Independent Stream and {{!RFC9920}} adds the Editorial Stream that are the different distinct publication streams under the RFC Series.    Mentions of the IETF Trust and intellectal property rights management in RFC8729, RFC9920 and their related RFCs is updated to recognize the IETF IPMC as the successor and replacement to the IETF Trust as the party responsible for providing the role of copyright holder and manager for those RFC Streams.

Additionally, as described the IETF Trust [TLP 5.0 section 8](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/), the IETF IPMC is assuming the management of the IP Rights for the RFC Series streams declared in the TLP 5.0.  Additionally, the IETF IPMC also assumes this role for the Editorial RFC Stream which was created after TLP 5.0 was published.  Addition detail on IPR managed by the IPMC for RFC Series Streams can be found in the IETF IPMC TLP version 6.0 publications.

##  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors

RFC 8714 defines the selection and recall processes for IETF Trustees, under which Trustees are directly selected by the designated selecting organizations (the IETF NomCom, the IESG, and the ISOC Board of Trustees) to serve as Trustees of the IETF Trust.
The process for selecting IETF IPMC Directors is structurally different but functionally equivalent. While IPMC Directors are not appointed directly by the selecting organizations, the outcome is the same: director selection authority is effectively exercised by the same RFC 8714-designated bodies, and director terms track the same durations specified in RFC 8714 for IETF Trustees.
Corporate Governance Context
The IETF IPMC is a Delaware nonstock corporation with no members. Under Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), such corporations typically operate as self‑perpetuating boards, meaning that directors are elected by the sitting board rather than by members or shareholders. This governance model is expressly reflected in the IPMC bylaws.
IPMC Director Selection Mechanism
The process for IPMC board composition is defined in IPMC Bylaws § 3.3, and operates as follows:


### Initial Board Formation (§ 3.3(a))
The initial directors of the IPMC were the IETF Trustees serving at the time of the IPMC’s incorporation. This ensured continuity of fiduciary responsibility and alignment between the Trust and the newly formed IPMC.


### Subsequent Director Selection (§ 3.3(b))

Upon expiration of an IPMC director’s term, the sitting IPMC Board elects a successor director. However, the pool of eligible candidates is constrained:

* Each director seat is associated with a specific nominating organization (IETF NomCom, IESG, or ISOC Board of Trustees), consistent with RFC 8714.
* When a term expires, the relevant nominating organization selects the individual to be nominated.
* That individual is then submitted to the IPMC Board, which formally elects the nominee as a director.

In practice, this means that while the legal act of election is performed by the IPMC Board (as required by Delaware law), the substantive selection authority rests with the RFC 8714-designated nominating organizations.

### Protection of Nominating Organization Rights
The rights of the nominating organizations are strongly protected by IPMC Bylaws § 3.6. That provision restricts the Board’s ability to:

* Modify eligibility requirements for directors, or
* Alter or eliminate the rights of nominating organizations to nominate directors,

unless such changes are approved by:

. A two‑thirds vote of all then‑serving directors, and
. The affirmative vote of any director representing a nominating organization that would be adversely affected by the change.

The practical effect of this safeguard is that no nominating organization can be disenfranchised or have its representation diluted without its own consent, expressed through its representative director’s affirmative vote. This creates a strong governance lock‑in consistent with both Delaware law and the community‑driven structure envisioned by RFC 8714.

### IPMC Director Recall

RFC 8714 also defines recall mechanisms for IETF Trustees appointed by each of the selecting organizations (IETF NomCom, IESG, and ISOC Board of Trustees).
Within the IPMC governance framework, these RFC 8714 recall authorities are implemented through IPMC Bylaws § 3.3(c). Under that provision:

* Each nominating organization retains the authority to replace its designated representative on the IPMC Board of Directors.
* When a nominating organization exercises its recall or replacement authority, the IPMC Board elects the replacement nominee in accordance with the bylaws.

As with director selection, the Board’s role is ministerial and legally required under Delaware corporate law, while the decision to recall or replace a director remains entirely with the relevant nominating organization, consistent with RFC 8714.

## Update to URLs in RFC5378

The existing URLs in RFC5378 which reference the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) web site (https://trustee.ietf.org/) will continue to be maintained as they appear in published documents and will be maintained in perpetuity.  There is need to update or modify existing references in I-Ds or RFCs.

Additionally, the IPMC has established a new web site for the [IETF IPMC](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) which will henceforth contain IPMC- specific materials, including the updated Trust Legal Provisions (which have been renamed the Technical Legal Provisions) version 6.0 and beyond.


# Legal Compliance and Advice from the IETF

The IETF IPMC is Delaware not-for-corporation and IRS designated 501(c)(3) public charity. Recognizing that the IETF IPMC and its director's first duty is compliance with laws and regulations, it is understood that at no point shall the advice and guidance from the IETF to the IETF IPMC, including that continained in this document and guidance such as found in {{!RFC8721}} shall be intended to ask for or require deviation from applicable legal requirements by the IPMC Directors.

# IETF IPMC recognition of IETF BCPs

The IETF IPMC bylaws obligate the IETF IPMC to manage IETF assets for the benefit of the IETF. Therefore, the IETF IPMC looks to comply with IETF BCPs, as far as legally possible to guide its directors in carrying out that obligation.
