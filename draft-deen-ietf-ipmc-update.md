# Introduction

The IETF Trust, a Virginia Common Trust was establised in 2005 to be the intellectical property (IP) manager for the IETF activity. Since then the IETF Trust has held and managed copyrights granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78 as detailed in {{RFC5378}} and its predecessors. The legal successor to the IETF Trust is the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation which will fill the IETF Trust's role of Intellectual Propoerty Mangemement (IPM) to the IETF.   This document recognizes this successor role and updates IETF documents with this recognition.

## IETF Trust

The [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) has provided intellectual property management for the IETF since 2005.  Following BCP78, authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents grant to the IETF Trust a set of rights to the work to enable the work to be used within the IETF activity.    This supports the document streams as described in the {{RFC9280}}.

## IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) a Delaware not-for-profit corpoation was incorporated in 2022 with the purpose of being the successor to the IETF Trust, continuing on the role and traditions of the IETF Trust and providing [IETF Intellectual Propoerty Management (IETF IPM)](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) just as the IETF Trust has.

# Updates

## References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

The IETF Intellectual Propoerty Management (IPM) role is hereby understood to be the operational role provided by the IETF Trust as mentioned in IETF documents inclduing {{RFC5378}} and {{BCP78}}.   Further, where appropriate the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation is understaood to be the legal entity succeeding the IETF Trust as the legal entity to which the rights granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents are granted.

## Appointments of IETF Trustees

RFC8714 details who IETF Trustees were appointed.  Henceforth, the process detailed in RFC8714 is updated to apply to the appointment of the Directors of the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) a Delaware not-for-profit Corporation established in 2022.
