# Introduction

The IETF Trust, a Virginia trust, was established in 2005 as the intellectual property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF. The IETF Trust has held and managed IPR, including those granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78, currently specified in {{!RFC5378}} and its predecessors.

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a Delaware not-for-profit corporation established in 2022 with the intention of being the successor to the IETF Trust, replacing it and assuming all of its roles and responsibilities.

This document updates RFC 5378, RFC8714 and other IETF documents to recognize that the IETF IPMC is now the proper custodian of all IETF-related intellectual property rights and successor in interest to the IETF Trust.

#  Updates

## References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

All references to “IETF Trust” in any IETF document, including RFCs, BCPs, Internet-Drafts, and other IETF publications, shall be read and interpreted as referring to the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IETF IPMC) as the successor entity. The IETF IPMC has assumed all rights, responsibilities, and obligations previously held by or attributed to the IETF Trust in such documents.

## Use of IETF Trust and IETF IPMC in other IETF IPR Framework Documents

The intellectual property rights framework for IETF contributions is established in RFC 5378 (BCP 78).  The IETF Trust has implemented this framework through its [Trust Legal Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) at https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions, and the IETF IPMC will continue this implementation as the successor entity.

All references to the IETF Trust in RFC 5378 and related operational documents shall be read as referring to the IETF IPMC effective upon the transition.

Updated copyright notices reflecting this change can be found in Section 6 of the [IPMC TLP](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp) at https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp.

Note that no retroactive changes of copyright notices in prior IETF documents are to be made.

## Intellectual Property Rights Held by IETF Trust

The rights held by the IETF Trust have transferred to the IETF IPMC, as the successor the IETF Trust.  Inquiries regarding licenses and other IPR topics should now be made to the IETF IPMC.

##  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors Appointment

The process defined in {{!RFC8714}} shall define the process by which IETF IPMC Directors are nominated   Nominations done via RFC8714 to the IETF IPMC shall also be eligible to accept appointment as IETF Trustees until the Trust is dissolved.

## Update to URLs in RFC5378

The existing URLs in RFC5378 which reference the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) web site (https://trustee.ietf.org/) will continue to be maintained as they appear in published documents and will be maintained in perpetuity.

Additionally, the IPMC has established a new web site for the [IETF IPMC](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) which will henceforth contain IPMC- specific materials, including the updated Trust Legal Provisions (which have been renamed the Technical Legal Provisions) version 6.0 and beyond.

# IETF IPMC recognition of IETF BCPs

The IETF IPMC bylaws obligate the IETF IPMC to manage IETF assets for the benefit of the IETF. Therefore, the IETF IPMC looks to comply with IETF BCPs, as far as legally possible. to guide its directors in carrying out that obligation.
