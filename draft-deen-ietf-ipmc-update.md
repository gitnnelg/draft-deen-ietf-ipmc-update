# Introduction

The IETF Trust, a Virginia trust, was established in 2005 as the intellectual property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF. The IETF Trust has held and managed IPR, including those granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78, currently specified in {{!RFC5378}} and its predecessors.

The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a Delaware not-for-profit corporation established in 2022 with the intention of being the successor to the IETF Trust, replacing it and assuming all of its roles and responsibilities.

This document updates RFC 5378, RFC8714 and other IETF documents to recognize that the IETF IPMC is now the proper custodian of all IETF-related intellectual property rights and successor in interest to the IETF Trust.


#  Updates

## References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

All references to “IETF Trust” in any IETF document, including RFCs, BCPs, Internet-Drafts, and other IETF publications, shall be read and interpreted as referring to the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IETF IPMC) as the successor entity.
The IETF IPMC has assumed all rights, responsibilities, and obligations previously held by or attributed to the IETF Trust in such documents.

# Websites and URLs

The IETF publishes information on intellectual property rights (IPR) at [IETF IPR](https://ietf.org/ipr) (https://ietf.org/ipr) and more general information at [ietf IPR process](https://ietf.org/process/ipr) (https://ietf.org/process/ipr) which deal with IETF IPR in general and includes patents.   Neither the IETF Trust, nor the IETF IPMC have any involvement with patents and all patent issues continue to be exclusively through the IETF at the mentioned web pages.

The IETF Trust, historically has published information related to licensing, assets, finances and notices of actions and changes on it's web site [https://trustee.ietf.org](https://trustees.ietf.org).  This web site shall be maintained in perpetuity as URLs to it appear in published documents and the Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) version 1.0-5.0 that were active at the time of an I-D submission and the date of a RFC publication will continue to apply to those works even after subsequent transfer of those IPR assets to the IETF IPMC.   This will ensure that the existing URLs in the copyright boilerplate and other sections of I-Ds and RFCs continue to work correctly for users of those documents.

The IETF IPMC, has established [https://www.ietf-ipm.org](https://www.ietf-ipm.org) as its official corporate website which it will use to publish governance and operational information including bylaws and financial statements, along with the updated Technical Legal Provisions (TLP 6.0) which provide licensing terms for I-Ds and RFCs whose copyrights are held by the IETF IPMC.

## Use of IETF Trust and IETF IPMC in other IETF IPR Framework Documents

The intellectual property rights framework for IETF contributions is established in RFC 5378 (BCP 78).  The IETF Trust has implemented this framework through its [Trust Legal Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) at https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions, and the IETF IPMC will continue this implementation as the successor entity.

All references to the IETF Trust in RFC 5378 and related operational documents shall be read as referring to the IETF IPMC effective upon the transition.

Updated copyright notices reflecting this change can be found in Section 6 of the [IPMC TLP](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp) at https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp.

Note that no retroactive changes of copyright notices in prior IETF documents are to be made.

## Advice to the IPMC Directors on the IETF IPMC on Rights to be Granted in IETF Documents

{{!RFC8721}} is advice to the IETF Trustees of the IETF Trust on rights to be granted in IETF documents.   This advice is updated to be to the IETF IPMC and its directors.

## Intellectual Property Rights Held by IETF Trust

The rights held by the IETF Trust have transferred to the IETF IPMC, as the successor the IETF Trust.  Inquiries regarding licenses and other IPR topics should now be made to the IETF IPMC.

## RFC Streams

{{!RFC8729}} defines a series of RFC Streams - IETF, IAB, IRTF and Independent Stream and {{!RFC9920}} adds the Editorial Stream that are the different distinct publication streams under the RFC Series.    Mentions of the IETF Trust and intellectal property rights management in RFC8729, RFC9920 and their related RFCs is updated to recognize the IETF IPMC as the successor and replacement to the IETF Trust as the party responsible for providing the role of copyright holder and manager for those RFC Streams.

Additionally, as described the IETF Trust [TLP 5.0 section 8](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/), the IETF IPMC is assuming the management of the IP Rights for the RFC Series streams declared in the TLP 5.0.  Additionally, the IETF IPMC also assumes this role for the Editorial RFC Stream which was created after TLP 5.0 was published.  Addition detail on IPR managed by the IPMC for RFC Series Streams can be found in the IETF IPMC TLP version 6.0 publications.

##  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors

### Selection and Nomination

{{!RFC8714}} specifies the process by which IETF Trustees are selected for the IETF Trust, this shall continue until the IETF Trust is dissolved.  The process defined in {{!RFC8714}} shall be the process by which IETF IPMC Directors are nominated.  While both the IETF Trust and the IETF IPMC coexist, the persons nominated as IETF IPMC Directors shall also be eligible to be IETF Trustees.

The initial directors of the IPMC were the IETF Trustees at the time of the corporations creation. Subsequent IPMC director selection is done in keeping with Delaware law, under which corporations such as the IETF IPMC which has neither stock holders nor members employs a self-perpetuating board where the sitting board elects its directors.  The process followed by the IETF IPMC is defined in its bylaws section 3.3(a),3.3(b) and 3.3(c) and for the purpose of updating RFC8714 to recognize the IETF IPMC, it is understood that the selections of individuals described in RFC8714 shall be mean to select the nominees from each nominating party and communicated to the IETF IPMC board for subsequent election following the IPMC bylaws section 3.3(b) and that nominating parties of candidates for election by the sitting IETF IPMC directors shall be those defined in RFC8714, namely the IETF NOMCOM, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustee.

Under the IPMC bylaws section 3.6, the IETF IPMC board is restricted from modifying the persons eligible to become directors or the rights of the nominating organizations to nominate directors requires a two-thirds vote by all then-serving directors, including the affirmative vote of any representative of a nominating organization that would be negatively impacted by such change.    The practical effect of this bylaw rule is that none of the nominating parties, namely the IETF NomCom, IESG or ISOC Board of Trustees, can be disenfranchised of their right to be represented without their own representative voting in favor of the change.

### IPMC Director Recall

The RFC8714 describes the processes for recall of Trustees appointed by the IETF NomCom, IESG and ISOC Board of Trustees.  These processes are understood to feed into the IETF IPMC bylaws section 3.3(c) where each nominating party can replace its representative on the IPMC Board of Directors.

## Update to URLs in RFC5378

The existing URLs in RFC5378 which reference the [IETF Trust](https://trustee.ietf.org/) web site (https://trustee.ietf.org/) will continue to be maintained as they appear in published documents and will be maintained in perpetuity.  There is need to update or modify existing references in I-Ds or RFCs.

Additionally, the IPMC has established a new web site for the [IETF IPMC](https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) which will henceforth contain IPMC- specific materials, including the updated Trust Legal Provisions (which have been renamed the Technical Legal Provisions) version 6.0 and beyond.


# Legal Compliance and Advice from the IETF

The IETF IPMC is Delaware not-for-corporation and IRS designated 501(c)(3) public charity. Recognizing that the IETF IPMC and its director's first duty is compliance with laws and regulations, it is understood that at no point shall the advice and guidance from the IETF to the IETF IPMC, including that continained in this document and guidance such as found in {{!RFC8721}} shall be intended to ask for or require deviation from applicable legal requirements by the IPMC Directors.

# IETF IPMC recognition of IETF BCPs

The IETF IPMC bylaws obligate the IETF IPMC to manage IETF assets for the benefit of the IETF. Therefore, the IETF IPMC looks to comply with IETF BCPs, as far as legally possible to guide its directors in carrying out that obligation.
