1.  Introduction

   The IETF Trust, a Virginia Common Trust was established in 2005 to be
   the intellectucal property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF
   activity.  The IETF Trust has held and managed IPR rights including
   those granted by authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents
   following the terms of BCP78, currently specified in RFC5378 and its
   predecessors.

   The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a
   Delaware not-for-profit corportion established in 2022 to succeed the
   IETF Trust, replacing it and assuming all its roles and
   responsibitlies.

   This document recognizes for IETF documentation purposes the IETF
   IPMC's successor role and updates IETF documents with this
   recognition.

1.1.  IETF Trust

   The IETF Trust (https://trustee.ietf.org/) has provided intellectual
   property management for the IETF since 2005.  Following BCP78,
   authors of IETF Contributions and IETF Documents grant to the IETF
   Trust a set of rights to their works to enable the work to be used
   within the IETF activity.  This supports the document streams as
   described in the RFC9280.

1.2.  IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation

   The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC), a
   Delaware not-for-profit corporation, was incorporated in 2022 with
   the purpose of being the successor to the IETF Trust, continuing on
   the role and traditions of the IETF Trust and providing IETF
   Intellectual Propoerty Management (IPM) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/)
   just as the IETF Trust has done since 2005.

2.  Updates

2.1.  References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

   The term "IETF Trust" is used in two ways in IETF RFCs and BCPs, both
   as the descriptive name for the role of holding IPR and the name of
   the legal entity which performs the role such as mentions in RFC5378.

   Where "IETF Trust" is used to refer to the function of rights-holder,
   "IETF IPM" shall be substituted.

   Where the "IETF Trust" legal entity is referenced, its successor the
   "Intellectual Property Management Corportation (IPMC)" shall be
   recgonized.

2.2.  Use of IETF Trust and IETF Intellectusl Property in Copyright
      Boilerplate

   Copyright boilerplate, the notice that appears in Internet Drafts
   (I-Ds) and published Requests for Comments (RFCs) is declared in the
   Legal Provisions which provide licensing information about the works
   held in the IETF Trust and IETF IPMC.  Since this boiilerplate is
   pubished by the IETF Trust and its successor the IETF IPMC, while it
   is coordinated with the IETF's BCP 78 updates, it is not included in
   this update.

2.2.1.  Intellectual Propoerty Rights Held by IETF Trust

   The rights held by the IETF Trust will transfer to its successor the
   IETF IPMC.  Inquiries may continue to be made to the IETF IPMC for
   licenses and other rights management topics.

2.3.  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors Appointment

   RFC8714 details how Trustees are appointed to the IETF Trust.  The
   process detailed in RFC8714 shall be updated to apply to the
   appointment of the Directors of the IETF Intellectual Property
   Management Corporation (IPMC), the Delaware not-for-profit
   Corporation established in 2022.  References to "IETF Trust" shall be
   read to refer to "IPMC," and "Trustee" or "Trustees" shall be read to
   refer to "Director" or "Directors".

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations
