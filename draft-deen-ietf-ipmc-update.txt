1.  Introduction

   The IETF Trust, a Virginia trust, was established in 2005 as the
   intellectual property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF.  The IETF
   Trust has held and managed IPR, including those granted by authors of
   IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78,
   currently specified in [RFC5378] and its predecessors.

   The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a
   Delaware not-for-profit corporation established in 2022 with the
   intention of being the successor to the IETF Trust, replacing it and
   assuming all of its roles and responsibilities.

   This document updates RFC 5378, RFC8714 and other IETF documents to
   recognize that the IETF IPMC is now the proper custodian of all IETF-
   related intellectual property rights and successor in interest to the
   IETF Trust.

2.  Updates

2.1.  References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

   All references to “IETF Trust” in any IETF document, including RFCs,
   BCPs, Internet-Drafts, and other IETF publications, shall be read and
   interpreted as referring to the IETF Intellectual Property Management
   Corporation (IETF IPMC) as the successor entity.  The IETF IPMC has
   assumed all rights, responsibilities, and obligations previously held
   by or attributed to the IETF Trust in such documents.

2.2.  Use of IETF Trust and IETF IPMC in other IETF IPR Framework
      Documents

   The intellectual property rights framework for IETF contributions is
   established in RFC 5378 (BCP 78).  The IETF Trust has implemented
   this framework through its Trust Legal Provisions
   (https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) at
   https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions, and the
   IETF IPMC will continue this implementation as the successor entity.

   All references to the IETF Trust in RFC 5378 and related operational
   documents shall be read as referring to the IETF IPMC effective upon
   the transition.

   Updated copyright notices reflecting this change can be found in
   Section 6 of the IPMC TLP (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp) at
   https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp.

   Note that no retroactive changes of copyright notices in prior IETF
   documents are to be made.

2.3.  Intellectual Property Rights Held by IETF Trust

   The rights held by the IETF Trust have transferred to the IETF IPMC,
   as the successor the IETF Trust.  Inquiries regarding licenses and
   other IPR topics should now be made to the IETF IPMC.

2.4.  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors Appointment

   The process defined in [RFC8714] shall define the process by which
   IETF IPMC Directors are nominated Nominations done via RFC8714 to the
   IETF IPMC shall also be eligible to accept appointment as IETF
   Trustees until the Trust is dissolved.

2.5.  Update to URLs in RFC5378

   The existing URLs in RFC5378 which reference the IETF Trust
   (https://trustee.ietf.org/) web site (https://trustee.ietf.org/) will
   continue to be maintained as they appear in published documents and
   will be maintained in perpetuity.

   Additionally, the IPMC has established a new web site for the IETF
   IPMC (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) which
   will henceforth contain IPMC- specific materials, including the
   updated Trust Legal Provisions (which have been renamed the Technical
   Legal Provisions) version 6.0 and beyond.

3.  IETF IPMC recognition of IETF BCPs

   The IETF IPMC bylaws obligate the IETF IPMC to manage IETF assets for
   the benefit of the IETF.  Therefore, the IETF IPMC looks to comply
   with IETF BCPs, as far as legally possible. to guide its directors in
   carrying out that obligation.

4.  Conventions and Definitions

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
