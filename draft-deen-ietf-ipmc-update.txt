1.  Introduction

   The IETF Trust, a Virginia trust, was established in 2005 as the
   intellectual property rights (IPR) manager for the IETF.  The IETF
   Trust has held and managed IPR, including those granted by authors of
   IETF Contributions and IETF Documents following the terms of BCP78,
   currently specified in [RFC5378] and its predecessors.

   The IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC) is a
   Delaware not-for-profit corporation established in 2022 with the
   intention of being the successor to the IETF Trust, replacing it and
   assuming all of its roles and responsibilities.

   This document updates RFC 5378, RFC8714 and other IETF documents to
   recognize that the IETF IPMC is now the proper custodian of all IETF-
   related intellectual property rights and successor in interest to the
   IETF Trust.

2.  Updates

2.1.  References to the IETF Trust in IETF RFCs and BCPs

   All references to “IETF Trust” in any IETF document, including RFCs,
   BCPs, Internet-Drafts, and other IETF publications, shall be read and
   interpreted as referring to the IETF Intellectual Property Management
   Corporation (IETF IPMC) as the successor entity.  The IETF IPMC has
   assumed all rights, responsibilities, and obligations previously held
   by or attributed to the IETF Trust in such documents.

3.  Websites and URLs

   The IETF publishes information on Intellectual Property Rigths at
   https://ietf.org/ipr (https://ietf.org/ipr) and more general
   information at ietf.org/process/ipr (https://ietf.org/process/ipr).

   The IETF Trust, historically has published information related to
   licensing, assets, finances and notices of actions and changes on
   it's web site https://trustee.ietf.org (https://trustees.ietf.org).
   This web site shall be maintained in perpetuity as URLs to it appear
   in published documents and the Trust Legal Provisions (TLP) version
   1.0-5.0 that were active at the time of an I-D submission and the
   date of a RFC publication will continue to apply to those works even
   after subsequent transfer of those IPR assets to the IETF IPMC.  This
   will ensure that the existing URLs in the copyright boilerplate and
   other sections of I-Ds and RFCs continue to work correctly for users
   of those documents.

   The IETF IPMC, has established https://www.ietf-ipm.org
   (https://www.ietf-ipm.org) as its official corporate website which it
   will use to publish governance and operational information including
   bylaws and financial statements, along with the updated Technical
   Legal Provisions (TLP 6.0) which provide licensing terms for I-Ds and
   RFCs whose copyrights are held by the IETF IPMC.

3.1.  Use of IETF Trust and IETF IPMC in other IETF IPR Framework
      Documents

   The intellectual property rights framework for IETF contributions is
   established in RFC 5378 (BCP 78).  The IETF Trust has implemented
   this framework through its Trust Legal Provisions
   (https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/) at
   https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions, and the
   IETF IPMC will continue this implementation as the successor entity.

   All references to the IETF Trust in RFC 5378 and related operational
   documents shall be read as referring to the IETF IPMC effective upon
   the transition.

   Updated copyright notices reflecting this change can be found in
   Section 6 of the IPMC TLP (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp) at
   https://www.ietf-ipm.org/tlp.

   Note that no retroactive changes of copyright notices in prior IETF
   documents are to be made.

3.2.  Advice to the IPMC Directors on the IETF IPMC on Rights to be
      Granted in IETF Documents

   [RFC8721] is advice to the IETF Trustees of the IETF Trust on rights
   to be granted in IETF documents.  This advice is updated to be to the
   IETF IPMC and its directors.

3.3.  Intellectual Property Rights Held by IETF Trust

   The rights held by the IETF Trust have transferred to the IETF IPMC,
   as the successor the IETF Trust.  Inquiries regarding licenses and
   other IPR topics should now be made to the IETF IPMC.

3.4.  RFC Streams

   [RFC8729] defines a series of RFC Streams - IETF, IAB, IRTF and
   Independent Stream and [RFC9920] adds the Editorial Stream that are
   the different distinct publication streams under the RFC Series.
   Mentions of the IETF Trust and IP Rigths management in each of these
   RFCs is updated to recognize the IETF IPMC as the successor and
   replacement to the IETF Trust and subsequently as the party
   responsible for providing the role of IP Rights holder and manage for
   those streams.

   Additionally, as described the IETF Trust TLP 5.0 section 8, the IETF
   IPMC is assuming the management of the IP Rights for the RFC Series
   streams.  In addition, to the RFC streams mentioned in TLP 5.0, the
   IETF IPMC also assumes this role for the Editorial RFC Stream which
   was created after TLP 5.0 was published.  Addition detail on IPR
   managed by the IPMC for RFC Series Streams can be found in the IETF
   IPMC TLP version 6.0 publications.

3.5.  IETF Trustees and IPMC Directors

3.5.1.  Slection and Nomination

   [RFC8714] specifies the process by which IETF Trustees are selected
   for the IETF Trust, this shall continue until the IETF Trust is
   disolved.  The process defined in [RFC8714] shall be the process by
   which IETF IPMC Directors are nominated.  While both the IETF Trust
   and the IETF IPMC coexist, the persons nominated as IETF IPMC
   Directors shall also be eligible to be IETF Trustees.

   The initial directors of the IPMC were the IETF Trustees at the time
   of the corporations creation.  Subsequent IPMC director selection is
   done in keeping with Delaware law, under which corporations such as
   the IETF IPMC which has neither stock holders nor members employs a
   self-perpetuating board where the sitting board elects its directors.
   The process followed by the IETF IPMC is defined in its bylaws
   section 3.3(a),3.3(b) and 3.3(c) and for the purpose of updating
   RFC8714 to recognize the IETF IPMC, it is understood that the
   selections of individuals described in RFC8714 shall be mean to
   select the nominees from each nominating party and communicated to
   the IETF IPMC board for subsequent election following the IPMC bylaws
   section 3.3(b) and that nominating parties of candidates for election
   by the sitting IETF IPMC directors shall be those defined in RFC8714,
   namely the IETF NOMCOM, the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustee.

   It is worth noting, under the IPMC bylaws section 3.6, the IETF IPMC
   board is restricted from modifying the persons eligible to become
   directors or the rights of the nominating entites to nomimate
   directors requries a two-thirds vote by all then-serving directors,
   including the affirmative vote of any representative of a nominating
   organization that would be negatively impacted by such change.  The
   practical effect of this bylaw rule is that none of the nominating
   parties, IETF NOMCOM, IESG or ISOC Board of Trustees, can be
   disenfranchised of their right to be represented without their own
   representative voting in favor of the change.

3.5.2.  IPMC Director Recall

   The RFC8714 describes the processes for recall of Trustees appointed
   by the IETF NomCom, IESG and ISOC Board of Trustees.  These processes
   are understood to feed into the IETF IPMC bylaws section 3.3(c) where
   each nominating party can replace its representative on the IPMC
   Board of Directors.

3.6.  Update to URLs in RFC5378

   The existing URLs in RFC5378 which reference the IETF Trust
   (https://trustee.ietf.org/) web site (https://trustee.ietf.org/) will
   continue to be maintained as they appear in published documents and
   will be maintained in perpetuity.  There is need to update or modify
   existing references in I-Ds or RFCs.

   Additionally, the IPMC has established a new web site for the IETF
   IPMC (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) (https://www.ietf-ipm.org/) which
   will henceforth contain IPMC- specific materials, including the
   updated Trust Legal Provisions (which have been renamed the Technical
   Legal Provisions) version 6.0 and beyond.

4.  Legal Compliance and Advice from the IETF

   The IETF IPMC is Delaware not-for-corportation and IRS designated
   501(c)(3) public charity.  Recognizing that the IETF IPMC and its
   director's first duty is compliance with laws and regulations, it is
   understood that at no point shall the advice and guidance from the
   IETF to the IETF IPMC, including that continained in this document
   and guidance such as found in [RFC8721] shall be intended to ask for
   or require deviation from applicable legal requirements by the IPMC
   Directors.

5.  IETF IPMC recognition of IETF BCPs

   The IETF IPMC bylaws obligate the IETF IPMC to manage IETF assets for
   the benefit of the IETF.  Therefore, the IETF IPMC looks to comply
   with IETF BCPs, as far as legally possible to guide its directors in
   carrying out that obligation.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
